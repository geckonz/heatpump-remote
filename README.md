# Universal Heatpump Controller
A project to enable remote control of legacy heatpumps, both a hardware and software project using commonly available hardware.

This project is open source and as such contributions are welcomed, both to requirements, design and implementation and testing.

## Requirements

Requirements are being described [here](./doc/requirements.md).

## Design

The design of the system is described [here](./doc/design/high_level_design.md), with diagrams produced in Draw.IO and source diagram files saved in the design/src directory.

## Hardware

Current hardware target is aimed at an Arduino Nano or similar. Actual selection will be confirmed as the design process progresses.

## Software

The language target is likely to be C, although Python is also being explored. This will be confirmed very soon along with the Hardware target.

## Useful Links

Assuming the design lands on C/C++ and Arduino, then the following will be useful.
